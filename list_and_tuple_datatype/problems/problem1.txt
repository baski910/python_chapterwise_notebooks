1. Write a function that returns True if two arrays, when combined, 
form a consecutive sequence. A consecutive sequence is a sequence without 
any gaps in the integers, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is a consecutive sequence, 
but 1, 2, 4, 5 is not.

2. check if the given string is balance. The string will have only {,},(,),[,} characters
s1 = "{{[]}(){}}"

3. Find the highest sum of adjacent numbers in the below list
list1 = [8,-6,9,3,12,7,4]

4 given a list of list with each inner list of equal size in sorted order. Find minimum element that is present in all inner list. For example given the list [[2,3,4,6,8],[1,2,4,6,9],[3,4,5,6,7],[2,5,6,8,9]] the answer will be 6
